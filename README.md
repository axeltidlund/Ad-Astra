Planning page for the game Ad Astra, a space themed fast paced 2d dungeon crawler roguelite.

### **Concept**

Finding yourself in the middle of outer space, you have to fight through advanced civilizations, abandoned space stations and alien planets using a variety of high tech weapons dealing different types of damage. As you progress you can unlock special behaviors when two different types of damage interact with each other.
